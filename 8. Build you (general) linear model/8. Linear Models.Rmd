# Dataset Cars

## Description of the dataset 
We will be using the `car` dataset from the `dslabs` package. 

The data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. The data were recorded in the 1920s.

Let's take a look at the data types:
```{r str}
str(cars)
kable(head(cars))
```
We can see that there are 50 observations for 2 variables

* **Speed**, which is a numerical variable, with measures of **cars speed** in **mph** 

* **Dist**, which is also a numerical variable, containing measures of **stopping distance**, in **feets**

## Variable types
* Simple physics lets us know that **distance** is a product of **time x speed**, we can thus understand that distance is dependent of in our case, the speed

* We will consider, even if no experimental manipulations were made, that *speed* is the *explanatory variable* and that *distance* is our *response variable*

## ScatterPlot Stopping distance per Speed

```{r  plot}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)")
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "red")
title(main = "Stopping Distance per Speed")

```

## Correlation?

We want to know if there is a correlation between speed and stopping distance. We will , for that, do a Pearsons correlation

### Pearsons correlation coefficient
* This coefficient is used to look is there is a *statistical relationship* between two continuous variables, it will help us understand the ***magnitude** and the **direction** of the relationship between our variables

* This correlation *"assigns a value between − 1 and 1, where..*
   * *0 is no correlation* 
   * *1 is total positive correlation*
   * *− 1 is total negative correlation*"

* Example: *"This is interpreted as follows: a correlation value of 0.7 between two variables would indicate that a significant and positive relationship exists between the two. A positive correlation signifies that if variable A goes up, then B will also go up, whereas if the value of the correlation is negative, then if A increases, B decreases".*

## Pearsons Correlation
```{r pearson}
correlation <- cor(cars$dist, cars$speed, method = 'pearson')
print(correlation)
``` 
We have obtained a correlation of approximately **0.807**, which indicate a strong **positive relationship** between *speed* and *time*

## Representation of the relationship between Speed and Distance
```{r plot2}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(cars, aes(speed,dist))
gg <- gg + geom_point()
gg <- gg + geom_smooth(alpha=0.3, method="lm")
print(gg)
```
We may now see how the speed seems strongly correlated with distance even if as we can see there seem to be some outliers

## Correlation vs causation
* "**Correlation** is a statistical association between variables", it is a "statistical indicator, but even if some variables covary, this may not be due to a direct causal link."

* **Causation** means that a change in one variable causes a change in another variable.", and that "there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the variables."

* *"A correlation doesn't imply causation, but causation always implies correlation"*

We may thus infer from pearsons correlation that there is a link between the two variables. But this may not mean that there is a cause-and-effect relationship. We have seen from the formula previously presented that **speed** has a causal effect on **distance**, and that it is also influenced by **time**

Thus we know that there is indeed causality from speed to distance 

Nevertheless we will try to fit our model in a **linear model** 

## ""General" Linear Model 
We are now going to do a general linear models which is *"a statistical method to relate some number of continuous and/or categorical predictors to a single outcome variable"*

### GLM -Assumptions
1. **Independence of observations **, which we will assume is present 
2. **Normality**, which we will check by looking if the data follows a *normal distribution*
3. **Linearity** which we will check by making a graph to see if there seem to be a linear relationship between the variables
4.**Homoscedasticity**, which we wil test after fitting our linear model


As *simple linear regressions* are made to test the influence of a continuous variable from the explanatory, we may want to do one

###  Normality
```{r normality}
hist((cars$dist), main="Cars distance",
     xlab ="distance")
hist((cars$speed), main="Cars speed",
      xlab = "speed")
```

We will assume that data is approximately normally distributed for speed, and that we may accept the distribution for distance since we results seem to have a normal distribution around 20-40
We may want to do further analysis but for the exercise I will allow my self to continue with this

### Linearity
We will rely on a scatterplot (again) to see the relationship between our variables
```{r linearity}
 plot(speed ~ dist, data = cars)
normality <- ggplot(cars, aes(speed,dist))
normality <- normality + geom_point()
normality <- normality + geom_smooth(alpha=0.3, method="lm")
print(normality)
```
We still see here that we have some outliers at 120mph but if we took this subject out we may have a really nice line that could go in our data
By putting our data on our logarithmic scale (as done before) we see that the data seem to be linar


## Simple regression
```{r regression}
speed.dist.lm <- lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars)
summary(speed.dist.lm)
```
We have here our informations which are...
* the **estimate** which is the value of the **y-intercept** of **8.28** and the estimated effect of **speed on distance** of **0.16**, the **standard error**,the **t value** and **p-value** of **1.49e-12** which is a very small number indicating that our *model fits well the data*

We will conclude that there is a *significant positive relationship* between **speed and distance**
