# Dataset1 - Beaver 2

We load the dataset beaver 2 : data`beaver2`:

While there is actually two datasets of beaver, I chose to use beaver2, since I used it in the 2nd markdown and though that it would be interesting to investigate it in more details.


## Description of Beaver2 
```{r beaver2}
library(knitr)
kable(head(beaver2))
str(beaver2)
```
We have shown the table of results showing only the "head" of the table that is containing the first 6 entries of the dataset. Since we saw in the previous markdown that the table was very long, I don't think it is necessary to show it entirely

So in our dataset we have...

* **4 variables** composed of *100 observations*.
The variables are: **day**, **time**, **temperature** and **activity**. 
* It seems that each of these four variables are *numerical*.
* These measure would then all quantitative

## Descrption of Beaver2 dataset from Source

* "**Reynolds (1994)** describes a small part of a study of the long-term temperature dynamics of beaver **Castor canadensis** in north-central Wisconsin. Body temperature was measured by telemetry every 10 minutes for four females, but data from a one period of less than a day for each of two animals is used there."

* **Day** :Day of observation (in days since the beginning of 1990), December 12–13 (beaver1) and November 3–4 (beaver2). - *Numerical variable*
* **Time**: Time of observation, in the form 0330 for 3:30am - *Numerical variable*
* **Temp**: Measured body temperature in degrees Celsius. - *Numerical variable*
* **Activity**: Indicator of activity outside the retreat. - *Numerical variable*

# Dataset 2 - Causes of Death in France

* The second dataset is a data set different types of causes of death in France


```{r CausesOfDeathFrance}
library(readr)
CausesOfDeathFrance <- read_csv("CausesOfDeathFrance.csv")
View(CausesOfDeathFrance)
kable(head(CausesOfDeathFrance))
str(CausesOfDeathFrance)
```

## Despcrition of Death Causes in France dataset eurostat

The dataset CausesOfDeathFrance in composed of *8 variables*

* **Time** : quantitaive variable
* **Geo** : qualitative variable
* **Unit**: qualitative variable
* **Sex**: qualitative variable
* **Age**: qualitative variable
* **ICD10**: qualitative variable
* **Value**: qualitative variable
* **Flag and Footnotes** :qualitative variable
 
* We have a total of *1056 observations*

## Description of hapiness dataset from the source
* **Data on causes of death (COD)** provide information on ***mortality patterns** and form a major element of **public health information**.

* The COD data refer to the underlying cause which - according to the **World Health Organisation (WHO)** - is "the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury".

* Data published in **Eurobase* are broken down by ***sex***,*** 5-year age groups***, ***cause of death*** and by ***residency*** and ***country of occurrence**. For stillbirths and neonatal deaths, additional breakdowns might include age of mother and parity

# Dataset 3 - Happiness

## Description of happiness dataset

* European quality of life survey with questions related to income, life satisfaction or perceived quality of society.
* Provides the average rating for the question How happy would you say you are these days? Rating 1 (low) to 10 (high) by country and by sex.


```{r happiness}
library(readr)
happiness <- read_csv("happiness.csv")
View(happiness)

## Despcrition of Hapiness dataset variables

* In the happiness dataset R recognizes 4 variables for 105 observations
* In reality we have 2 variables

## Variables of Hapiness dataset
* Gender : Qualitative numerical variable
